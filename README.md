Jira-Kanban-Cards
=================

This project was created for printing Jira tickets as Kanban cards, in order to cut them and put them on a wall. Many plugins I found for Jira did not generate the pretty result I was looking for. In addition to the fact, that I am not a passionated Java developer, but love APIs, this tool is created with PHP and the use of the Jira REST API.

The print-ready Jira cards will look like this:
